### Dataset

> #### NBA 2023 Player Performance Dataset

We chose the performance of popular NBA players during the 2023 season as the dataset. The data includes information such as number of shot attempts, time, distance, and score. The databases we refer to are as follows:

[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhavalrupapara/nba-2023-player-shot-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhavalrupapara/nba-2023-player-shot-dataset)

We processed this data into a visual form to give a clearer picture of the players' strengths.


### Problematic

The NBA is one of the hottest sports events around the world, featuring numerous outstanding athletes. However, despite the abundance of performance data available online, it often suffers from the following issues:

1. **Incomplete Data Processing:** Many datasets remain unprocessed, lacking systematic organization and analysis, and thus fail to provide comprehensive insights into athlete performance.

2. **Poor Data Visualization:** While some athlete performance data has been processed, the methods employed are often simplistic, resulting in charts with poor image clarity. This makes it difficult for observers to understand and compare the data effectively.

3. **Lack of Interactivity:** The existing data lacks dynamic effects and interactivity, making it challenging for observers to engage with and comprehend the relationships and trends between different players.

Our project aims to address these challenges by focusing on processing and visualizing the shooting data of popular NBA players during the 2023 season. We strive to highlight key performance metrics such as shot attempts, accuracy, scoring patterns, and other relevant statistics through visually appealing charts. Our target audience includes NBA enthusiasts, analysts, fans, and others interested in gaining deeper insights into player dynamics. By providing interactive and informative visualizations, we aim to enable our audience to better understand and analyze athlete performance.  


### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work

> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
