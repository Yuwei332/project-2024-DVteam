### Dataset

#### NBA 2023 Player Performance Dataset

We have selected the performance data of popular NBA players during the 2023 season as our dataset. This dataset comprises crucial information such as the number of shot attempts, timing, distance, and scoring data. The source databases we have referred to are shown below:

Player Shots Analysis: In-Depth Insights and Performance in 2023: [NBA 2023 Player Shot Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhavalrupapara/nba-2023-player-shot-dataset)

Player's performance information: [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhavalrupapara/nba-2023-player-shot-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhavalrupapara/nba-2023-player-shot-dataset)

We'll meticulously processe this data into a visual format to provide a clearer understanding of the strengths exhibited by the players.

### Problematic

The NBA is one of the hottest sports events around the world, and it has several great athletes. Although there is a large amount of data about athletes’ performance in the game on the Internet, these data presents the following problems:

1. **Incomplete Data Processing:** Many data are not fully processed and are in a raw state, lacking systematic organization and analysis.

2. **Poor Data Visualization:** Though some of the athletes' performance data on the web have been processed, the processing is often simple, and always with poor image clarity. These simple processing methods may make the data difficult to understand, confusing the observer.

3. **Lack of Interactivity:** The data lacks dynamic effects and interactivity. It’s not vivid enough for observers to view easily and compare relationships and trends between different players.

Our project focuses on processing and visualizing the shooting data of popular NBA players during the 2023 season. Our goal was to highlight key performance metrics such as shot attempts, accuracy, scoring patterns, and other relevant statistics to provide visually appealing charts of player performance.

Our target audience includes NBA enthusiasts, analysts, fans, and anyone keen on delving deeper into player dynamics. By delivering interactive and informative visualizations, we aspire to empower our audience with enhanced insights to better understand and analyze athlete performance.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work

> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
