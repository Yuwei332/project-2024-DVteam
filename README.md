## 🏁 Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

### Dataset

> # NBA 2023 Player Performance Dataset

We chose the performance of popular NBA players during the 2023 season as the dataset. The data includes information such as number of shot attempts, time, distance, and score. The databases we refer to are as follows:

[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhavalrupapara/nba-2023-player-shot-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhavalrupapara/nba-2023-player-shot-dataset)

We processed this data into a visual form to give a clearer picture of the players' strengths.


### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work

> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
